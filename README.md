how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 

9.367 for sure.

## Self-Reflection:

As a learning experience for testing, this was actually good because at my job as a UI specialist intern, I just starting participating in QA testing alongside QAT/UAT for build days and learning about Linting, webpack, Jest, and Cypress can help boost my progress at work. I might even impress the guy I'm shadowing on Monday with what I just learned so this was one of the more awesomer lessons. the other ones are good too but this was even more useful!

### How long it took me to finish this?

2 hours. not bad...
